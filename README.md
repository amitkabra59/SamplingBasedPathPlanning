# Sampling Based Path Planning

The objective is to produce a continuous motion for a  robot that connects a start configuration S and a goal configuration G, while avoiding collision with known static obstacles using Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree(RRT). RRT path is then smoothen to reduce number of edges.


### Install

This project requires **Matlab** environment

### Data

Data consists of data points of obstacles in the environment which should be avoided.
